Kudos to Dave Gandy who has created an incredible cool icon font called [Font Awesome][1].

This font fits perfectly into JavaFX as

* all these beautiful icons are scalable vector graphics
* each icon (unicode character) can be styled with css
* incredible lightweight (one font 249 icons)

This project provides a dude with which it should be as easy to use these icons in JavaFX apps.
